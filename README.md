# Case Study - Bellabeat
## Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

## BigQuery & Tableau

In this instance of the case study, I initiated the process by formulating appropriate inquiries. Subsequently, I refined the data within Excel and organized it for further processing. This involved utilizing queries in BigQuery to extract pertinent details. Subsequent to this, I devoted time to scrutinizing the gathered information and proceeded to generate visual representations of the outcomes through Tableau. Lastly, I formulated recommendations for stakeholders based on the insights derived.

The dataset was amassed during the period spanning from March 12, 2016, to May 12, 2016. Participants were equipped with fitness trackers that amassed data encompassing metrics such as steps taken, minutes engaged in physical activity, calories burned, distance covered, and more.

Please take a look at the visualizations I have created using [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/CapstoneDashboard_Bellabeat/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) for this particular case study.
